# VGG16-Cat-vs-Dog-Classification
# Cat vs Dog Image Classification using VGG16 (Transfer Learning)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a Deep Learning Computer Vision application that classifies images as **Cat** or **Dog** using **Transfer Learning with VGG16**.  
The model is trained using TensorFlow/Keras and evaluated using accuracy/loss metrics and classification report.
